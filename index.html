        <h2>Web Security</h2>
        <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from 
            web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
        <p id="web-security-answer">
            If I understood the task correctly, then we are supposed to recommend how we could improve Web security.
            There were suggestions within the module, and a website, that could best describe what to implement for web security: 
            "https://www.acunetix.com/blog/web-security-zone/7-web-application-security-best-practices/"
            
            "Sanitazation of data", a practice were we can ensure that the data a system accepts is in the right format, can be done manually or by using a well-known third party solution.
            
            "Secure authorization and authentication", ensures that authorization and authentication systems are hard for attackers to crack. 
            It can be done manually or through an open-standard authorization protocol/framework. OneLogin and Okta are some examples of such protocols/frameworks.

            "Continuous Development/Continuous Integration (CI/CD)", is an automatic process of integrating and delivering code to production.
            It catches oversights from developers and helps maintain the reliability of the changes coming to a codebase.

            An "automatic user timeout", could be implemented to ensure protection to users who have left their credentials hanging in a browser for a long time.

            Configure yoru web server to use HTTPS and HSTS. 
            HTTPS encrypts data sent between your client and server. 
            This ensures that login credentials, cookies, post requests data and header information are not easily available to attackers.

            I hope that I answered the question correctly.
